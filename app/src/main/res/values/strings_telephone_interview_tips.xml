        <!--what is tel interview-->
        <item>
            Telephone interviews often take place during the early stages of the job interview process.
            Some recruiters will use them as a method of shortlisting; others as an opportunity to learn
            more about the candidates who are applying to work for them.

            \n\nA telephone interview is often an effective way for a company to screen many candidates quickly and cost-effectively,
            without having to invest the same level of time and resources needed for face-to-face interviews.

            \n\nTelephone interviews (and increasingly, Skype interviews) are usually straightforward, since the aim is to eliminate
            weaker candidates, rather than to test stronger ones. Often, all recruiters are looking for is a calm,
            confident telephone manner and an intelligent set of responses to common interview questions.

            \n\nIn some occupations, phone communication is an important responsibility.
            In this situation, the recruiter will be evaluating how well you can present yourself, convey messages and get your point
            across clearly and concisely.

            \n\nGraduate-level telephone interviews are usually short - most last fewer than 30 minutes - and typically comprise a mix of
            competency-based questions and questions about your CV, work experience and education.

            \n\nThe questions that you will be asked at this initial stage are likely to include your motivations for applying,
            your career aspirations and to see if you would be a good fit for the company. They are also an opportunity for you
            to ask any initial questions about the job or the organisation.

            \n\nYour aim is to convey enthusiasm and commitment in a short conversation.
            Sometimes the recruiter will inform you before the interview what you will be discussing - use this to your advantage.
            If, for example, they say that they will be discussing your motivations for applying, draw up a list of your skills and
            explain how they fit in with the company and the position that you have applied for,
            including positives about the company such as their track record, successes and opportunities for development.

        <!--Before the tel interview-->
        <item>
            Even highly capable candidates can be rejected at this early stage if they are inadequately prepared or not used to speaking
            in a professional manner over the phone. For many candidates, the whole situation can feel unnatural -
            without eye contact it can be difficult to build rapport and display a strong personality with your interviewer.

            \n\n - Practice
            \nPractice is useful, especially if you haven\'t worked in an office or used a telephone to speak with clients in previous jobs.
            If you can, try getting friends or family members to call you and ask interview questions. Candidates who don\'t think they\'ll
            have any trouble with this style of assessment are often the ones that experience the most difficulty.

            \n\n - Research
            \nIt\'s important to find out as much as you possibly can about a company, and a job role, before any type of interview;
            a telephone interview is no exception. You may receive some information from your prospective employer,
            but make sure you also visit their website, competitor websites, read relevant trade press, and keep up
            to date with current industry-specific commercial awareness issues. Research the size of a company, its structure,
            its products and services, its markets, competitors and future plans.
        </item>
        <!--creating the right environment-->
        <item>
            Many candidates find it hard to adapt to telephone interviews and struggle to get into interview \'mode\'
            when talking to interviewers over the telephone. This is not good enough; you need to be as
            professional and presentable as you would in a face-to-face situation from the moment your interviewer calls.

            \n\n - What to Wear
            \nAlthough it may sound strange, putting on smart, interview-style clothes before your scheduled telephone interview can
            help you to focus and get into a professional mindset. You don’t have to wear a tie if that makes you feel uncomfortable.

            \n\n - Have everything in hand
            \nIf you\'re being interviewed, then you have probably already sent them your CV;
            make sure you have it to hand because it\'s fairly likely they will be drawing on it. Similarly,
            if there is information about the employer or the job that you worry you might forget then make a note of it.

            \n\n -  Location, location
            \nTelephone interviews are usually scheduled in advance. As such, there is no excuse for being in a room with bad
            telephone signal or with lots of background noise. Make sure you are somewhere quiet and where you can speak
            uninterruptedly without any risk of poor telephone reception. Coffee shops might seem like a good idea, but
            espresso machines, babies and teenagers are one of the noisiest combinations. Getting these things wrong won\'t
            set the best first impression with your interviewer and risks damaging your impact over the phone.

            \n\n - Posture and Behaviour
            \nStanding up, rather than sitting down, can be a good way to keep your confidence and enthusiasm levels high.
            Professional salespeople use this trick to keep them focused and alert when making high-pressure sales calls.
            \n\nThe best salespeople often recommend using a headset when making, or taking, important calls.
            Doing so helps you concentrate on talking and thinking, rather than holding your phone, and allows you
            to use your hands to complement your responses.

            \n\n - Get into a positive mind-set
            \nDo some breathing exercises before the interview to calm your nerves, and give yourself a pep talk,
            reminding yourself of all of your achievements to date. I would also recommend visualising positive outcomes,
            such as being offered the job. This will remind you of your end goal, motivating you to give your best performance
            during the phone call.

            \n\n - Get organised
            \nCheck that you have phone signal, full battery, have the hiring manager and recruiters name and number saved on your phone.
            Make sure that you are clear on who is calling who, and at what time. Be ready for the call 15 minutes before,
            ensuring you are in a quiet space and can talk. If you are at work, step outside of the office, and if you are at home,
            switch off the TV and radio, and let anyone else in the house know that you can\'t be interrupted for the next hour or so.
            Remember to also turn off your personal phone to avoid the chances of this ringing.

        <!--during the tel interview-->
        <item>
            Answer the phone in a professional manner
            Pick up within two to three rings, and answer in a professional manner, for instance, "Hello Alex speaking".
            Maintain this professional tone throughout the call.

            \n\n - Adjust your body language
            \nEven though your interviewer can\'t see you, getting your body language right during your telephone interview
            can make all the difference to how you sound and come across. Sitting up straight or standing when answering questions
            will improve how well you project your voice, and smiling and gesticulating will inflect a positive intonation as you speak.

            \n\n - Speak at an even pace
            \nIt is harder to appreciate just how fast we are speaking over the phone, especially when we are nervous.
            If you notice this happening, pause and take a deep breath. I would also recommend getting up and walking around,
            this can help you to regulate your speaking patterns and feel more at ease.

            \n\n - Remember your manners
            Just because the interviewer can’t see you, that doesn’t mean you can get away with bad manners.
            Avoid eating and chewing gum, this can be very off putting for the interviewer, and certainly don\'t start doing
            anything else which could be perceived as rude during a face-to-face interview, such as scrolling through social
            media on your phone or messaging your friends. It will be obvious to the interviewer that you are distracted.

            \nInterrupting people too much is also deemed as bad manners, and unfortunately is more likely to happen during a
            telephone interview, mainly because you can’t read the interviewer’s visual cues in order to judge whether they have
            finished talking. Avoid interrupting the interviewer by pausing for a second once you think they have finished speaking,
            before you start responding.

            \n\n - Conclude as you would a face-to-face interview
            \nOn the subject of manners, remember to thank the interviewer for their time, and state that you enjoyed learning more
            about this opportunity. Reiterate your interest in the role, and clarify the next steps if the hiring manager hasn\'t
            already done so.

            \nAgain, just because this isn’t a face-to-face interview, doesn\'t mean you can’t leave a strong last impression with the
            interviewer.
        </item>
        <!--what questions to ask-->
        <item>
            Asking questions during a telephone interview is a good idea,
            and shows your aptitude to the job in question.
            This is not the time to ask about holiday entitlement, or company bonuses; you should use this as an opportunity to find
            out about what the day to day entails, how big your potential team will be, and what opportunities for career progression are.

            \n\n Example Questions;

            \n\n - How would you describe the responsibilities of this position?
            \n\n - What qualities are you looking for in the person you hire to join this company?
            \n\n - If I was hired, how would I be interacting with you and your department? What would be your expectations and your measures for success?
            \n\n - How would I get feedback on how well my work meets these expectations?
            \n\n - What do you view as the most challenging part of this job?
            \n\n - Why is the last person who held this position leaving?
            \n\n - Who does this position report to?
            \n\n - How would you describe the company culture?
        </item>
        <!--after the tel interview-->
        <item>
            After the interview, if you are still interested in taking this opportunity further,
            I would advise that you follow up just as you would a face-to-face interview. Phone your recruiter straight after
            the interview to give your feedback, and send a thank you note to the interviewer via your recruiter, affirming again,
            just how interested you are in this opportunity. Remember to keep your phone close by in the coming days.

        <!--the dos and donts-->
        <item>
            Do\'s:

            \n\n - Your research.
            \nJust like a face-to-face interview, start by finding out as much as you can about the company.
            Find out about the size and structure of the company, its products and services and the markets
            it works in (including looking at competitor’s websites).
            The best place to start is the employer’s website,
            but also keep an eye out for news articles, which may mention plans for growth and expansion.

            \n\n - Write down any questions you want to ask.
            \nA phone interview is a really good opportunity to find out more about the role you\'ve applied for,
            the company culture and opportunities for growth. And always make sure you have a pen and paper handy
            for note taking (here\'s our list of interview questions for employers, just in case you’re struggling for inspiration).

            \n\n - Have your CV to hand.
            \nIn all probability, the recruiter will have a copy of it too,
            so you may not be asked about it in detail. However, they may open the interview by asking questions
            about your experience. It’s also a good way to ease into the call while allowing them to find out how communicative you are.

            \n\n - Relax.
            \nTelephone interviewers are more concerned with finding out about your personality than your answers to questions.
            If you prepare sufficiently for your interview, you will naturally be more relaxed, and more confident that you will
            be able to answer the questions that you have been asked in sufficient detail.

            \n\n - Don\'t use slang or colloquialisms and make sure that you are polite throughout the conversation.
            \nKeep slang words for your friends or informal conversations. Also try not to talk too quickly,
            so that the interviewer can understand what you are saying.

            \n\n - Try to sound confident and capable.
            \nIt is really important that you focus on what the interviewer is saying, so you can answer the questions properly and correctly.
            Listen to the question, ask for clarification if you need it and speak slowly, confidently and clearly.

            \n\n - Smile.
            \nOK, so we know it sounds strange – but it actually works. Although your interviewer can\'t see you
            (because that would be weird), always try and remain smiling throughout the conversation.
            It helps ensure you sound upbeat and, according to research, people can actually hear you smile. You have been warned.

            \n\n - Listen.
            \nUndoubtedly the most important element to consider. Take on board all elements of their questions,
            and make note of anything that seems of particular importance, just in case they refer back to it later.
            Even if they don\'t, you can use it as a cheat sheet when answering the inevitable \'any other questions\'
            invitation at the end of the interview.

            \n\n Don\t\'s

            \n\n - Treat it differently from a face-to-face interview.
            \nStrange as it sounds, it\'s a good idea to dress like a professional.
            Obviously the interviewer can\'t see you, but it\'s harder to feel – and therefore sound – professional if you\'re
            still sitting in your dressing gown.

            \n\n - Get distracted.
            \nYou need to remain focused on the task at hand, something that can prove difficult,
            if you still have one eye on the TV. The same goes for your partner/family members.
            They might be being supportive, but your interview should be a two way conversation.
            Having their frantic arm flapping and mouthed words of encouragement in the background will only put you off.

            \n\n - Eat.
            \nThere is a time and a place for snacking. Five minutes before your phone interview isn\'t it.
            You might think you’re being quiet – but chances are that you aren\'t.
            A mumbled answer because you have your mouthful is memorable,
            but for all the wrong reasons. Especially important if you’re a nervous eater.

            \n\nInterrupt.
            \nThe easiest way to avoid irritating the interviewer is to let them finish their sentence,
            so always allow for a gap before you begin answering. Not only will it give you time to
            think of a coherent response, it will also mean you don’t speak over the person you\'re
            trying to impress. Just make sure you approach gaps with a degree of caution.
            There\'s a difference between a courteous pause and an awkward silence…

            \n\n - Sound bored.
            Remember when we said about remaining attentive a few paragraphs ago?
            Well it\'s kind of a big deal… Again, it may seem obvious, but when you haven\'t done a telephone interview before,
            it\'s easy to overlook. Try to sound positive, and avoid yawning or mumbling your responses.
            Even if you haven\'t understood every single sentence, just go with it.
            Make the right noises, and you\'re a shoe in for the next stage.
