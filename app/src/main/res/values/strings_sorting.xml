            One of the oldest sorts known to man due to its simplicity.

            \nBased on the properly of a sorted list that any two adjacent elements are in sorted order.

            \nIn a typical iteration, each adjacent pair of elements is compared, starting with the first two elements,
            all the way to the final two elements

            \nEach time two elements are compared;
            – if they are already in sorted order, nothing is done to them and the next pair of elements is compared.
            - in the case where the two elements are not in sorted order, the two elements are swapped, putting them in order.

            \n\nExample:
            \nFirst Pass:
            \n( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.
            \n( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4
            \n( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2
            \n( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
            \n
            \n          Second Pass:
            \n        ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )
            \n      ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2
            \n    ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
            \n  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
            \nNow, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed.
            The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
            \n
            \n          Third Pass:
            \n        ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
            \n      ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
            \n    ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
            \n  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

            \n\nTime complexity is O(n2).
            \n\nMemory Space Complexity is O(1).

        <!--Selection Sort - basic-->
        <item>
            The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order)
            from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array;

            \n\n1) The subarray which is already sorted.
            \n2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

            \n\nIn every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

            \n\nFollowing example explains the above steps:

            \n\narr[] = 64 25 12 22 11

            \n\n// Find the minimum element in arr[0...4]
            \n// and place it at beginning
            \n11 25 12 22 64
            \n
            \n          // Find the minimum element in arr[1...4]
            \n        // and place it at beginning of arr[1...4]

            \n
            \n          // Find the minimum element in arr[2...4]
            \n        // and place it at beginning of arr[2...4]

        <!--Insertion Sort - basic-->

            The approach of Insertion Sort:
             \n - Pick any item and insert it into its proper place in a sorted sublist
             \n - Repeat until all items have been inserted

            \n\n(One implementation) in more detail:
            \n - Consider the first item to be a sorted sublist (of one item)
            \n – Insert the second item into the sorted sublist, shifting items as necessary to make room to insert the new addition
            \n - Insert the third item into the sorted sublist (of two items), shifting as necessary
            \n - Repeat until all values are inserted into their proper position

            \n\nExample:

            \n\n12, 11, 13, 5, 6

            \nLet us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 5 (Size of input array)
            \n
            \n          i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
            \n        11, 12, 13, 5, 6
            \n
            \n          i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13
            \n        11, 12, 13, 5, 6
            \n
            \n          i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
            \n        5, 11, 12, 13, 6
            \n
            \n          i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
            \n        5, 6, 11, 12, 13

            - Fast sorting algorithm
            \n - Compares items and swaps them if they are out of sequence
            \n - However, here the list is divided into smaller lists which can then be sorted (Divide and Conquer approach)
            \n - Usually done through recursion
            \n - The premise of quicksort is to separate the "big" elements from the "small" elements repeatedly.

            \n\n&#8226; Choose a "pivot" value that will be used to divide big and small numbers
            \n - different methods to choose a pivot value
            \n - e.g. we can simply use the first element of the list as the pivot value

            \n\n&#8226; Once the pivot value selected
            \n - all values smaller than the pivot are placed toward the beginning of the set
            \n - all the ones larger than the pivot are placed to the right
            \n - this process essentially sets the pivot value in the correct place each time

            \n\n&#8226; Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts (each side of the pivot).

            \n\nExample:
            \n\narr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70}
            \nIndexes:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
            \n
            \n          low = 0, high =  6, pivot = arr[h] = 70
            \n        Initialize index of smaller element, i = -1
            \n
            \n          Traverse elements from j = low to high-1
            \n        j = 0 : Since arr[j] &lt;= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j])
            \n      i = 0
            \n    arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70} // No change as i and j
            \n  // are same
            \n
            \n          j = 1 : Since arr[j] &gt; pivot, do nothing
            \n        // No change in i and arr[]
            \n
            \n          j = 2 : Since arr[j] &lt;= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j])
            \n        i = 1
            \n      arr[] = {10, 30, 80, 90, 40, 50, 70} // We swap 80 and 30
            \n
            \n          j = 3 : Since arr[j] &gt; pivot, do nothing
            \n        // No change in i and arr[]
            \n
            \n          j = 4 : Since arr[j] &lt;= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j])
            \n        i = 2
            \n      arr[] = {10, 30, 40, 90, 80, 50, 70} // 80 and 40 Swapped
            \n    j = 5 : Since arr[j] &lt;= pivot, do i++ and swap arr[i] with arr[j]
            \n  i = 3
            \narr[] = {10, 30, 40, 50, 80, 90, 70} // 90 and 50 Swapped
            \n
            \n          We come out of loop because j is now equal to high-1.
            \n        Finally we place pivot at correct position by swapping
            \n      arr[i+1] and arr[high] (or pivot)

        <!--Merge Sort - basic-->
        <item>
            Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two
            halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r)
            is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.

            \n\nPseudo code for details;
            \n\nMergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
            \nIf r > l
            \n1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:
            \nmiddle m = (l+r)/2
            \n2. Call mergeSort for first half:
            \nCall mergeSort(arr, l, m)
            \n3. Call mergeSort for second half:
            \nCall mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
            \n4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
            \nCall merge(arr, l, m, r)

            \n\nHere\'s how merge sort uses divide-and-conquer:

            \n\n 1 - Divide by finding the number q of the position midway between p and r.
            Do this step the same way we found the midpoint in binary search: add p and r , divide by 2, and round down.

            \n\n 2 - Conquer by recursively sorting the subarrays in each of the two subproblems created by the divide step.
            That is, recursively sort the subarray array[p..q] and recursively sort the subarray array[q+1..r].

            \n\n 3 - Combine by merging the two sorted subarrays back into the single sorted subarray array[p..r].

            \n\nWe need a base case. The base case is a subarray containing fewer than two elements, that is, when p≥r,
            is greater than or equal to, r, since a subarray with no elements or just one element is already sorted.
            So we\'ll divide-conquer-combine only when p &lt; r.

            \n\nLet\'s see an example. Let\'s start with array holding [14, 7, 3, 12, 9, 11, 6, 2],
            so that the first subarray is actually the full array, array[0..7] ( p = 0 and r = 7).
            This subarray has at least two elements, and so it\'s not a base case.

            \n\n - In the divide step, we compute q = 3.

            \n\n - The conquer step has us sort the two subarrays array[0..3], which contains [14, 7, 3, 12], and array[4..7],
            which contains [9, 11, 6, 2]. When we come back from the conquer step, each of the two subarrays is sorted: array[0..3]
            contains [3, 7, 12, 14] and array[4..7] contains [2, 6, 9, 11], so that the full array is [3, 7, 12, 14, 2, 6, 9, 11].

            \n\n - Finally, the combine step merges the two sorted subarrays in the first half and the second half,
            producing the final sorted array [2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14].

            \n\nHow did the subarray array[0..3] become sorted? The same way. It has more than two elements, and so it\'s not a base case.
            With p = 0 and r = 3, compute q = 1, recursively sort array[0..1] ([14, 7]) and array[2..3] ([3, 12]), resulting in array[0..3]
            containing [7, 14, 3, 12], and merge the first half with the second half, producing [3, 7, 12, 14].

            \n\nHow did the subarray array[0..1] become sorted? With p = 0 and r = 1, compute q = 0, recursively sort array[0..0] ([14])
            and array[1..1] ([7]), resulting in array[0..1] still containing [14, 7], and merge the first half with the second half,
            producing [7, 14].

            \n\nThe subarrays array[0..0] and array[1..1] are base cases, since each contains fewer than two elements.

            n\nTime Complexity is O(n log n) and Space Complexity is O(n).

        <!--Heap Sort - basic-->
        <item>
            Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
            It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end.
            We repeat the same process for remaining element.

            \n\nWhat is a Heap?

            \n\nHeap is a special tree-based data structure, that satisfies the following special heap properties:

            \n\n 1- Shape Property: Heap data structure is always a Complete Binary Tree, which means all levels of the tree are fully filled.

            \n\n 2- Heap Property: All nodes are either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to each of its children.
            If the parent nodes are greater than their child nodes, heap is called a Max-Heap, and
            if the parent nodes are smaller than their child nodes, heap is called Min-Heap.

            \n\nHow Heap Sort Works?
            \nHeap sort algorithm is divided into two basic parts:

            \n\n - Creating a Heap of the unsorted list/array.
            \n\n - Then a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest/smallest element from the heap,
            and inserting it into the array. The heap is reconstructed after each removal.

            \n\nInitially on receiving an unsorted list, the first step in heap sort is to create a Heap data structure(Max-Heap or Min-Heap).
            Once heap is built, the first element of the Heap is either largest or smallest(depending upon Max-Heap or Min-Heap),
            so we put the first element of the heap in our array. Then we again make heap using the remaining elements,
            to again pick the first element of the heap and put it into the array.
            We keep on doing the same repeatedly until we have the complete sorted list in our array.

            \n\nTime Complexity is O(n log n) and space complexity is O(k + n).

        <!--Counting Sort - basic-->
        <item>
            Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range.
            It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing).
            Then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.

            \n\nLet us understand it with the help of an example.
            \nFor simplicity, consider the data in the range 0 to 9.
            \nInput data: 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2
            \n1) Take a count array to store the count of each unique object.
            \nIndex:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
            \nCount:     0  2  2  0   1  1  0  1  0  0
            \n
            \n          2) Modify the count array such that each element at each index
            \n        stores the sum of previous counts.
            \n      Index:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
            \n    Count:     0  2  4  4  5  6  6  7  7  7
            \n
            \n          The modified count array indicates the position of each object in
            \n        the output sequence.
            \n
            \n         3) Output each object from the input sequence followed by
            \n       decreasing its count by 1.
            \n     Process the input data: 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2. Position of 1 is 2.
            \n   Put data 1 at index 2 in output. Decrease count by 1 to place
            \n next data 1 at an index 1 smaller than this index.

            \n\nTime Complexity and space complexity are O(k + n).

        <!--Bucket Sort - basic-->
        <item>
            Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range. For example, consider the following problem.
            \nSort a large set of floating point numbers which are in range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are uniformly distributed across the range.
            \nHow do we sort the numbers efficiently?

            \n\nA simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm. The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm
            (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Ω(n Log n), i.e., they cannot do better than nLogn.
            Can we sort the array in linear time? Counting sort can not be applied here as we use keys as index in counting sort.

            \n\nHere keys are floating point numbers.
            The idea is to use bucket sort. Following is bucket algorithm.

            \n\nbucketSort(arr[], n)
            \n1) Create n empty buckets (Or lists).
            \n2) Do following for every array element arr[i].
            \n.......a) Insert arr[i] into bucket[n*array[i]]
            \n3) Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
            \n4) Concatenate all sorted buckets.

            \n\nTime complexity; Average O(n) Worst case O(n*n). Space Complexity is O(n + k).
