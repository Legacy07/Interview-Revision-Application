        <!--Cv or Resume-->
        <item>
            There are three major differences between CVs and resumes are the length, the purpose and the layout.
            A resume is a brief summary of your skills and experience over one or two pages, a CV is more detailed
            and can stretch well beyond two pages. The resume will be tailored to each position whereas the CV
            will stay put and any changes will be in the cover letter.

            \n\nA CV has a clear chronological order listing the whole career of the individual whereas a resume\'s
            information can be shuffled around to best suit the applicant. I would say the main difference between a resume and
            a CV is that a CV is intended to be a full record of your career history and a resume is a brief, targeted list
            of skills and achievements.

            \n\nA resume is the preferred application document in the US and Canada. Americans and Canadians would only use a
            CV when applying for a job abroad or if searching for an academic or research oriented position.

            \n\nIn the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, a CV is used in all contexts and resumes aren\'t used at all.
            The CV prevails in mainland Europe and there is even a European Union CV format available for download.

            \n\nIn Germany, the CV is more commonly known as a Lebenslauf (true to the latin origins) and is only one of many application
            document the poor German job seekers must produce to get an interview.

            \n\nIn Australia, India and South Africa, the terms resume and CV are used interchangeably.
            The term resume is used more for jobs in the private sector and CV is more commonplace when applying for public service positions.

            It takes a recruiter less than one minute to scan a programmer resume and to start a short list of eligible candidates
            for an interview. A resume format with dark colors for the heading with a column of content to the right of the article
            is more appealing to the eye than a general resume.

            \n\nThe art of writing a resume is to format the resume using a chronological, functional, or combination format.
            I recommend you think about what to write before you begin because it will need a combination of technical skills
            with qualitative data, interpersonal skills, achievements, volunteer work, or freelance experience to stand out
            from the pile of resumes recruiters often receive. As a recruiter scans your resume,
            it has to tell a story of your past, present, and where you plan to be in the future. So, it\'s a good idea to format your CV
            in a reverse-chronological format.

            \n\n&#8226; It front-loads your strengths and shows the peak of your career at the top of the resume.
            \n\n&#8226; It makes the whole thing searchable.
            \n\n&#8226; It saves recruiter\'s time.

            \n\n - The Layout

            \n\nMaking your CV fit on one side of a page of A4 is a good approach if you have not had work experience before or
            have perhaps just had one job since leaving school. For most other people fitting their educational background and
            various work experiences and achievements into such a small space is not likely to be realistic.

            \n\nIf possible, keep your CV layout to two sides of A4 and three at the most.
            This may mean you are tempted to squash a lot of information in by reducing typeface sizes and using small sub-headings.
            Generally speaking, this is a mistake and you are better off cutting things and shortening sentences to make your content
            fit the size of CV you are looking for.

            \n\n - TypeFace
            \n\nConventional typefaces are the best ones to go for when writing a CV. It is hard to imagine the circumstances in which a
            simple choice of Times New Roman would be frowned upon. However, to make your CV stand out from the pack,
            other ones like Mistral, Calibri or Arial are quite acceptable.

            \n\nAvoid informal-looking fonts such as Comic Sans or AR Carter. If you have any doubts about your choice,
            then change the typeface for something more conventional. Only if you are going for a graphic design job or
            similar should you even consider the funkier typefaces.

            \n\n - Font Size
            \n\nYour name at the top of the CV can be in a larger font size than the rest of the CV.
            Use a similar font size for headings that break up sections of your CV along the way.
            If you are pushed for room, then simply make sub headings bold rather than employing a larger font size.

            \n\nFor the main body of the text try not to go too small. A font size of about 11 is as small as you should go
            otherwise what you are saying is likely to be hard to read. On the other hand you should not go so large that your
            CV appears to have been padded out.

            \n\nAlso, it\'s important to tailor your CV:

            \n\n - Tailoring your Skills
            \n\nSkills are the most important thing to change when you tailor your CV.
            A straightforward way to do this is by looking at the skills desired by the employer in question and listing
            any of the skills you have, how you acquired them and where you’ve put them into practice.

            \n\n - Tailoring your Experience
            \n\nYou can\'t change your employment history, but you can select what employment and experience is included on your CV.
            Although everyone says that you should list your most recent employment on your CV, a better tip would be to list all
            recent and relevant work experience. What is relevant, of course, relies upon the job you’re applying for.
            As mentioned before, relevant experience will be completely different for a bar job compared with an engineering vacancy.

            \n\n - Tailoring your Hobbies
            \n\nIt\'s really not a good idea to stick with "Going to the gym, seeing friends and popular culture"
            as your hobbies on every CV you send. In fact, it’s not a good idea to have those boring, "generic" hobbies on any CV.

            \n\nMake sure your hobbies reflect you as a person and your ability to do the role you are applying for,
            as well as your passion for that industry.

            \n\nFor example, if you’re applying for a creative position, emphasise your love of drawing,
            visiting art galleries or your passion for a particular artist. Going for a role that requires
            a lot of writing? Try focusing on a particular genre of literature that you enjoy, or if you\'re
            going for a role that holds a lot of responsibility, focus on your love for hobbies that include team work (e.g. sports).
        </item>
        <!--Action Verbs/Power words-->
        <item>
            Using action verbs in resume writing is as easy as any other form of writing, so long as you know what to include and
            what to look for. Here are two tests to determine if you are using passive voice in your resume writing:

            \n\n 1 - Verb Test: Look for helping verbs, especially forms of the verb “to be.”

            \n\n 2 - "By You" Test: Can you insert the phrase "by you" after the verb? Does the sentence still make grammatical sense?
            If yes, this signifies passive voice.

            \n\nScan the resume for these warning signs and replace passive resume writing with more active verbs and sentences.
            Here are a few examples of passive resume sentences:

            \n\n 1 - A 20 percent revenue growth was realized in our department over two years.

            \n\n 2 - A promotion to supervisor was awarded to me after only one year of service.

            \n\n 3 - Responsibility was recognized as one of my strengths.

            \n\nHere are the same examples rewritten using active voice:

            \n\n 1 - My team realized 20 percent revenue growth over two years.

            \n\n 2 - After only one year, I earned a promotion to supervisor.

            \n\n 3 - Recognized for responsibility and proactive decisions.

            \n\nThe only time when passive voice is appropriate is when you want to draw more attention to results instead of yourself.
            This is very rare, and you should focus on your achievements rather than your company\'s results.

            \n\nMake your resume shine with achievements
            \nAnother action-word strategy is to use "achieving" language rather than "doing" language.
            How do you determine if the sentence is doing or achieving? Ask yourself three simple questions:

            \n\n 1 - Can anyone perform this function?

            \n\n 2 - Is this the standard, run-of-the-mill description?

            \n\n 3 - Did any results come from this action?

            \n\nIf your answers are yes, yes, and no, you are listing descriptions that only show what you can do.
            What you want instead is to show what you have achieved.

            \n\nHere are a few examples of "doing" sentences and how to convert them into "achieving" sentences:

            \n\n&#8226; Doing: Responsible for inventory control and ordering products.

            \n\n&#8226; Achieving: Optimize inventory by monitoring for product shortages and ensuring efficient service usage.

            \n\n&#8226; Doing: Help company sell more products and gain revenue.

            \n\n&#8226; Achieving: Increase profit margins by creating effective sales plans and implementing strategies to solidify
            client retention.

            \n\nUsing action verbs and active voice makes all the difference in your resume, so it\'s worth the extra effort.
            Show the employer what you can bring to the table by listing past achievements and notable contributions and you\'ll
            increase your chance of getting an interview.

        <!--key points to include-->
        <item>
            Whether a potential employer asks to see your curriculum vitae, CV or resume, they\'re looking for one thing –
            a document that proves why you\'re the ideal candidate to invest their time and money in. Essentially it\'s
            a sales brochure, pinpointing the interesting USPs (unique selling points) that make you stand out from the crowd.

            \nThere\'s no universally accepted format, but your CV should cover these elements:

            \n\n&#8226; Your Details in the Header Section.
            \n\n&#8226; A Brief Bio
            \n\n&#8226; Work Experience
            \n\n&#8226; Educational History
            \n\n&#8226; Skills
            \n\n&#8226; Interests
            \n\n&#8226; References
        </item>
        <!--the header-->
        <item>
            Make it easy for employers to get in touch. Include your name, address, main phone number and email address.
            Don\'t use email addresses that look unprofessional.

            \n\nAlso, help a recruiter understand the value an organization will gain by hiring you.
            One way to accomplish an effective use of links is to show off your work by adding
            hyperlinks to an online portfolio, work samples, or blog posts to a programmer resume.
            Here are a few examples of links on a CV:

            \n\n&#8226; LinkedIn profile
            \n&#8226; Personal Website/Blog
            \n&#8226; GitHub link
            \n&#8226; StackOverflow link
            \n&#8226; Upwork Profile (Freelance work)
        </item>
        <!--summary-->
        <item>
            A summary of a career is a four to five sentence description that highlights a career which includes soft skills and
            technical skills with a few references to your ability to work effectively in a team. Here are a few ways to
            outline an opening summary:

            \n\n&#8226; Reference the number of years in an industry
            \n&#8226; Present skills in training employees
            \n&#8226; Enhance tech programs completed in your position

            \n\nThe ultimate goal is to craft the resume with no fluff;
            only include quantitative content that shows a human resource recruiter you are fit for the position.

            \n\nExamples:

            \n\n&#8226; Results-oriented C programmer with 8+ years experience developing, testing, and maintaining enterprise software applications.
            Designed and developed over 30 advanced applications from use cases and functional requirements.
            Investigated new technologies to make sure that XYZ Corp remained the leader in setting industry standards in past years.

            \n\n&#8226; Designed a customer Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software that reduced administrative work by 35% in the first 90 days".

            \n\n&#8226; Hard-working listing programmer with a flair for creating elegant solutions in the least amount of time.
            As a freelance programmer, created SAS datasets of clinical data and developed macro programs to improve efficiency
            and quality of data management for Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Looking to use my programming skills to help boost
            Piper Companies\' data management efficiency.

        <!--educational history-->
        <item>
            What qualifications you choose to include on your CV is largely dependent
            on what stage of your career you’re in, and where your most impressive accomplishments lie.

            \n\n - If you\'ve just left school…
            \n\nIf you\'re a recent school leaver, place emphasis on your GCSEs, A levels, or any other accomplishments you\'ve
            achieved whilst you were in education.

            \nAs most roles you apply for won\'t be looking for much direct work experience,
            this is a great way to help sell yourself for a role. At the very least, a pass in Maths and English is essential for
            many jobs, so be sure to include these.

            \nList the subjects you studied and your grades, but feel free to condense them down into less detailed descriptions
            if you’re not sure they\'re your strongest selling point. This will also allow more space for other experience
            e.g. part time/summer jobs that directly relate to the role you\'re applying for.

            \n\n - If you’ve just left University…
            \n\nAs a recent graduate you should always focus on your degree, and include college and school level information with less detail.

            \nIf you have a large number of GCSEs, list the amount and the grades you got rather than each individual subject
            (e.g. 11 GCSEs A-C). This saves space and makes your CV clearer and easier to read.

            \nWork experience should also come secondary to education at this stage. Structure your CV by including your
            degree information first, and then go on to include any jobs you may have held in the following section.

            \nIncluding individual modules isn\'t absolutely necessary, but could increase your chances if the modules relate
            closely to the role you\'re applying for. If you don\'t have a lot of work experience, this is a good way to
            demonstrate your skills and ability to do the job.

            \n\n - If you\'re still studying…
            \n\nIf you\'re still in education, or you\'re developing your knowledge by taking an additional qualification,
            information on your current area of study is likely to be the most relevant.

            \nInclude any predicted grades, if you have them, and dates for when you’re likely to complete your studies.
            You may also choose to add in more information about the modules you’ve covered so far, especially if they\'re
            directly related to the role.

            \nThis way, employers can identify any specific knowledge you\'ve
            already gained in the industry, and won\'t be in the dark about completion dates when it comes to offering you the role.

            \n\n - If you have a professional qualification…
            \n\nPerhaps you haven\'t been in education for a while, and have decided to brush up on your knowledge in an industry
            or learn something. In this case, you would benefit most from detailing your most recent educational qualification,
            and keeping the others brief.

            \nIf you aren\'t that far removed from education, and it relates equally to the role, then place an equal amount of
            emphasis on each qualification.

            \nIf you took a course for the purpose of developing current skills and gaining a higher-level role in a career you
            already have experience in, then make sure previous work experience or related education is also adequately included.
            This enables the employer to see how you’ve grown and developed, and they will admire your dedication to the field.

            \n\n - If you\'ve been in employment for a while…
            \nIf you\'ve taken a break from your career, it\'s likely that you\'ve developed an extensive portfolio of
            work experience on your CV.

            \nDon\'t add unnecessary clutter by including a great deal of education on top of that – especially if it happened 10 years ago.
            Detailing jobs you\'ve had that represent your talents and skills, not to mention, dedication and passion for the industry you\'re in,
            will be what attracts most prospective employers.

            \nInclude your education, but detailed descriptions aren\'t necessary in this situation; condense information into short
            lists, with grades and courses – but there\'s no need for module choices or individual subjects to be addressed in detail.

            \n\nRemember: what you include is heavily dependent on what kind of role you\'re applying for and its requirements.
            Take the time to read the job specification and skills needed and cater your CV to that.

            \nBear in mind that your most successful achievements (educational or otherwise) are the ones worth showcasing,
            so draw attention to your most impressive accomplishments and focus on what paints you in the best light from an employer\'s
            perspective.

        </item>
        <!--Work experience-->
        <item>
            The work experience section of your CV is where you show your professional track record.
            It needs to be accurate, highlight your achievements and include relevant points that prove you\'re the right person for the job.

            \n\n1. Draw parallels
            \n\nList your previous jobs in chronological order with the most recent employment first.
            If there are some parallels between your old company and the new one you are applying to, then it\'s worth providing
            information about their similarities. This can show the hiring manager that you have the skills for the job and it
            is important if your current company isn\'t well known.

            \n\nAs an example, this might include stating that your previous employer worked with many clients in the media sector,
            if you know this is a key customer base for the company you\'re applying to.

            \n\n2. Be factual
            \n\nAll aspects of your CV, including your dates of employment, must be factually correct.
            If you have a gap in employment and are worried about how this may come across, you can always enter dates as month-to-month
            or even year-to-year, rather than specific dates.

            \n\nFor jobs that were many years ago, or if you’ve had a number of jobs in a relatively short period, you can group these jobs,
            for example, \'2001-2003 worked in temporary roles within the retail sector\'.

            \n\n3. Prove you have what they want
            \n\nResearch the job details and personal specifications for the type of job you want. Then,
            under each of the jobs in your experience section, use bullet points to illustrate that you have exactly the skills and expertise they’re after.

            \nRemember to be specific. If they want sales experience, then specify how many customers you dealt with,
            the types of responsibilities you had and give an example to show off your skills.

            \n\nFor Example: \'I have experience in a demanding sales role where I was required to meet monthly customer targets.
            I dealt with X customers on a daily basis making X amount of sales in a period of X months, exceeding my target by X%.
            This role taught me how to handle a busy and dynamic environment. I learnt to adapt to different customer needs to meet
            my monthly goals.\'

            \n\n4. Voluntary work counts
            \n\nWhere you have limited work experience, or are looking to change career entirely, other experience outside of paid employment
            could show your capabilities. This might include unpaid work placements, community activities, such as working with a
            charity or being a student representative for your course.

            \n\nEmployers will respond positively to reading about any extracurricular activities you\'re involved in,
            especially if they demonstrate energy and community spirit, because these are exactly the kind of behaviours
            they want in their employees.

            \n\n5. Highlight your achievements
            \n\nMany job hunters write their CVs like a job description. They faithfully list the duties they performed and their
            responsibilities. However, they fail to show the positive impact of their teamwork or contribution to the organisation as a whole.

            \n\nEnsure you don\'t make this mistake by using achievement statements instead.
            \nFor instance:
            \n\n&#8226; Since taking over the credit control function, over 95% of long-standing debts have been recovered,
            some of which had been owing for more than two years
            \n&#8226; Trained 50 staff in Excel, which increased the capabilities of employees and their time efficiency in producing reports
            \n&#8226; Developed a new policy that significantly reduced risks to public health by making it mandatory for
            organisations to train and induct staff properly.

            \n\nThe examples show how you can expand upon your skills and show how you have delivered meaningful results to the organisation,
            its customers and wider society.

            \n\n6. Use positive language
            \n\nChoose your words carefully to reflect that you are a high performing, \'can-do\' type of employee.
            Use positive action words, such as ‘excellent’, ‘initiated’ and ‘accelerated’ to show the calibre and pace at
            which you have been working.

            \n\nNever include any implicit criticisms about previous jobs. If you refer to difficult challenges,
            explain how you helped overcome them or omit them completely.

            \n\n7. Focus on your strengths
            \n\nIf you are looking for a job that is different from your previous work experience, then instead of using the heading
            \'career history\' and listing your jobs chronologically, try using \'key skills and experience\'.
            This will give you the flexibility to draw attention to the most relevant career experiences you have had.

            \n\nYou will still need to include a short employment history with dates, but this can be relegated to the second page.
            The aim is to convince the recruiter that you are a great candidate on the first page.
            This approach also works well for people who have noticeable gaps in their employment history.

            - Use structure to your advantage
            \nIf you have no work experience, your degree is likely to be your biggest selling point.
            But no two degrees are the same, nor are the specialised skills or results.

            \n\nOur template has \'placements &amp; projects\' section ahead of \'Education &amp; qualifications\'.
            However, if you think your grades and qualifications are more impressive than your projects,
            feel free to switch the sections around.

            \nRemember, the more impressive your achievement, the further up your CV it should sit.

            \n\n - Focus on transferable skills
            \nDespite your limited experience in employment, remember that you have plenty of transferable skills to offer
            thanks to your degree.

            \nThat\'s right; your three years of swotting got you more than just a shiny certificate.

            \n\nTransferable skills, otherwise known as soft skills, are utilised in every role and every industry.
            And the best part is that you’ve developed a mountain of them through your degree.

            \n\nGave a group presentation? That\'s teamwork, communication, leadership and presenting skills right there.
            Submitted your assignments on time? Well you developed time management and organisation skills, too.

            \n\nFocus on your transferable skills in your CV and you’ll show any employer you\'ve got more to offer than a brand new
            qualification.

            \n\n - Saving space
            \nIf you\'re struggling to keep your CV to two pages, here are a few quick ways to make room.

            \nFirstly, try narrowing the margins or removing the footer.

            \nSecondly, try reducing the font size. However, make sure you don\'t reduce your font size below 10 or recruiters will
            have to invest in a magnifying glass.

            \n\nLastly, try neatening up your grades into one line. For example, you might write your GCSE results like this:

            \n10 GCSEs grades A* – C, including B in English and C in Maths.
