            Normally group discussions are used in the selection process for management trainees and executive positions.<br />The objective of a group discussion is to mainly check your team playing skills because as a manager,<br />you will be working in organisations with people. Employers are looking for candidates who have potential<br />to be executives and to lead teams of people.<br /><br />The group discussion is a test of your interactive skills and how good you are at communicating with other people.<br />You\'ll have to be able to understand the other person\'s point of view while making your point and ensure that your<br />team as a whole reaches a win-win situation; in other words a solution/agreement which is both<br />feasible and accepted by all members of the team. A group discussion, to that extent, is a simulated managerial setting.<br /><br />- Groups of 8-10 candidates are formed into a leaderless group, and are given a specific situation to analyse<br />and discuss within a given time limit, which may vary between twenty minutes and forty-five minutes.<br />- They may be given a case study and asked to come out with a solution for a problem.<br />- They may be given a topic and are asked to discuss the same.<br /><br /><strong>Skills assessed during a Group Discussion:</strong><br /><br />- <strong>Leadership Skills;</strong> Ability to take leadership roles and be able to lead, inspire and carry the team along to help them achieve<br />the group\'s objectives.<br /><br />- <strong>Communication Skills;</strong> Candidates will be assessed in terms of clarity of thought, expression and aptness of language.<br />One key aspect is listening. It indicates a willingness to accommodate others views.<br /><br />- <strong>Interpersonal Skills; </strong>People skills are an important aspect of any job. They are reflected in the ability to interact<br />with other members of the group in a brief situation. Emotional maturity and balance promotes good interpersonal relationships.<br />The person has to be more people centric and less self-centred.<br /><br />- <strong>Persuasive Skills;</strong> The ability to analyse and persuade others to see the problem from multiple perspectives.<br /><br />Essentially, the group discussion is a test of your ability to think on your feet, your analytical prowess and your<br />ability to make your point in a team-based environment.

            <strong>Practice</strong><br />There is a saying "<strong>Practice Makes a Man Perfect</strong>" and it is absolutely right. To get sixes in group discussion match you<br />need practice and the best way is to practice it in front of the mirror. A mirror is your twin, it will reflect your gesture,<br />posture, your way of speaking way and you can get an image of yours.<br /><br /><strong>Research the Company, and Show What You Know</strong><br />Do your homework and research the employer, the interviewers and the industry, so you feel comfortable with your knowledge of the company.<br />You should be able to find out a lot of information about the company\'s history, mission and values, staff,<br />culture, and recent successes on its website. If the company has a blog and a social media presence,<br />they can be useful places to look, too.<br />So during the group discussion and for Q&amp;A, you are ready to take initiative and show that you know well about the company and willing to work here more than other candidates.

            - <strong>Ensure you contribute to the group</strong><br /><br />Ensure you contribute to the conversation. Often candidates take up behaviours or actions that aren\'t actively<br />contributing to the group\'s outcome. For example, taking lead of the group, standing up to make notes on a board.<br />Be careful not to fall into the trap of regarding these behaviours as earning you some positive points.<br />In some cases these behaviours can even lead to you being alienated by other group members.<br /><br />- <strong>Manage your body language</strong><br /><br />Ensure good body language and maintain relaxed eye contact. Make sure when you are listening to others you<br />are attentive and demonstrate this through nods and gestures of agreement. If you feel uncomfortable in<br />terms of how you are sitting, simply \'mirroring\' other people will help. Smiling always helps too.<br /><br />-<strong> Manage conflicts effectively</strong><br /><br />Avoid confrontation and ensure you allow everyone a chance to speak. If someone is consistently rude and aggressive,<br />do not resort to this behaviour yourself. Assessors will pick this up. Avoid being forceful or speaking over anybody.<br /><br />- <strong>Manage your time</strong><br /><br />Keeping a check on the time will earn you points. Suggesting that you will keep a check on the time and providing<br />regular updates throughout the discussion will also work well. However,<br />if you commit to this responsibility then make sure you maintain that check.<br />There is nothing worse than the session running out of time when you have appointed yourself as time-keeper.<br /><br />- <strong>Include others</strong><br /><br />Keep an eye out for those who do not say anything and take the opportunity to ask them for their opinions.<br />This will gain you both assessors\' appreciation and other group member\'s gratitude.<br /><br />- <strong>Ensure you are a team player</strong><br /><br />More often than not, the group discussion exercises require coming to an agreement on a particular issue. For example,<br />you may be given individual proposals and asked to agree on two of these as a group. In these situations,<br />remember you do not always have to get your ideas accepted. Try to do what is better for the company or<br />organisation as presented in the exercise, rather than what you think might benefit you.

            <strong>Do\'s<br /></strong><br />- <strong>Arrive early</strong><br />When you\'re competing against a number of other candidates, it\'s essential you make the most of every opportunity to<br />stand out &ndash;and not be remembered for the wrong reasons.<br />Aside from being punctual and courteous, arriving ahead of schedule has another unique advantage in this situation.<br />At a group interview, you can expect to be monitored from the moment you enter the building, so the earlier you arrive,<br />the longer you have to impress. It also allows you to interact with other candidates in a less formal setting, showing<br />off your social skills.<br /><br />However, always bear in mind that there is such a thing as arriving too early. Getting there before the security guard won\'t<br />win you any bonus points.<br /><br />- <strong>Remember the icebreaker</strong><br />Before any of the actual tasks begin, you\'ll almost always be asked to provide some sort of introduction for yourself<br />(or worse, some sort of introduction for someone else in the group). To avoid embarrassing situations, always prepare your<br />answer beforehand. Your intro needn\'t be long, provided it\'s pertinent and engaging.<br /><strong><br />Remember:</strong> if you can\'t think of anything particularly exciting, embellishments are allowed.<br />Although it may be true, \'um, I\'m not sure, I\'m not really that interesting&hellip;\' isn\'t going to give you the start you need.<br /><br />- <strong>Sit up straight</strong><br />Body language can make all the difference. Do it right, and you\'ll appear attentive and alert,<br />showing your interviewers that you&rsquo;re genuinely interested in what they have to say. Do it wrong, however,<br />and you\'ll only look listless and lethargic (not the qualities of choice for many employers).<br />There\'s nothing wrong with relaxing as the interview progresses and showing that you\'re comfortable.<br />But you needn\'t let your attitude compromise your posture.<br />So try and sit up straight wherever possible. Just remember to breathe occasionally&hellip;<br /><br />- <strong>Prepare questions</strong><br />If you\'ve prepared for your interview correctly, you should have carried out plenty of research about what the<br />company does and their position within the market. Always use this to your advantage during the obligatory<br />\'any other questions\' portion of the interview.<br />However, if you genuinely can\'t think of anything to bring up for discussion, don\'t force it.<br />Asking an irrelevant question just for the sake of asking one is more transparent than you may think.<br /><br />- <strong>Include everyone/Be inclusive</strong><br />Although your leadership skills are being assessed, don\'t be tempted to go overboard.<br />One of the most important facets of leadership is the ability to ensure everyone\'s opinions are heard, not just voicing your own.<br />If there\'s an introvert in the group, getting them involved in the task and encouraging them to participate<br />will win you major points, both with your fellow candidates and with your interviewers.<br /><br /><strong>Don\'t\'s</strong><br /><br />- <strong>Be fake</strong><br />It may be a clich&eacute;, but sometimes the best advice is just to be yourself. Chances are your interviewers<br />will be experienced in group situations, and therefore adept in detecting when someone\'s overdoing it.<br />Trying too hard to stand out is not going to make you many friends, especially amongst your assessors,<br />so always try to be as genuine as possible.<br />Also, laughter. Unless you\'re going for a job as a pantomime villain, leave your over-exuberant<br />chuckles and guffaws at the door.<br /><br />- <strong>Talk over people</strong><br />This is one of the most common mistakes of the group interview try-hard.<br />When the competitive nature of the interview kicks in, it can be tempting to increase the volume to get your point across.<br />However, whatever role you\'re applying for, you should never underestimate the importance of teamwork.<br /><br /><strong>Remember:</strong> the wisest people don\'t always speak the loudest, but they always make their voices heard.<br />So always try to think before you speak&hellip;<br /><br />- <strong>Get lost in the group</strong> <br />There\'s a fine balance between this point and the last. It\'s highly likely that,<br />whether genuine or not, one or two people in the group will try and take control.<br />If and when this happens, don\'t let yourself be intimidated or overwhelmed. Instead, use them to your advantage.<br />If you don\'t agree with their points, feel free to be controversial and offer your own opinion,<br />then open up the discussion to the group. A wise man once said: the tallest tree catches the most wind. Think about it&hellip;<br /><br />-<strong> Become too informal</strong><br />As in any other interview situation, there\'s a certain etiquette for group interviews which should always be adhered to.<br />It\'s fine to appear comfortable and relaxed in some instances. For example, taking your coat/scarf/hand-knitted woolly<br />mittens off is perfectly acceptable (and indeed can be a particular bugbear for some recruiters if left on).<br />Do not, however, use this as an excuse to leave your manners at the door.<br /><br /><em><strong>- Number one:</strong></em> don\'t refer to your interviewers or co-interviewees as \'mate\'. Your interviewers are not your friends.<br /><br /><em><strong>- Number two:</strong></em> never swear. Being controversial is ok, as long as you have a well-articulated,<br />polite and appropriate argument. Being rude, vulgar or offensive, however, is definitely not.<br /><br /><em><strong>- Number three:</strong></em> avoid discussing any excesses you might enjoy in your own time (obvious topics include gambling and<br />drinking etc, but we\'re sure you get the picture). Perhaps save that particular tale for another day/week/lifetime &ndash;<br />it\'s unlikely to impress<br /><br />- <strong>Lose concentration</strong><br />Finally, it\'s essential to maintain maximum concentration at all times. Take notes,<br />keep eye contact at an acceptable (and socially acceptable) level, smile, nod,<br />and generally try and look enthusiastic and engaged throughout.<br />Avoid spending your time staring off into space, or worse, checking your phone during proceedings.<br />The same also applies to doodling. If you can\'t listen to the introductory presentation without practicing your<br />inner Picasso, you probably won\'t be invited back any time soon.
