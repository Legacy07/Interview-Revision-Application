    <string name="what_is_behavioural_questions">Behavioural questions are asked to get to know your personality, to understand your resume more deeply,
        and just to ease you into an interview. They are important questions and can be prepared for. </string>

    <!--Interview Prep Grid Texts-->
    <string name="topText">Go through each of the projects or components of your resume and ensure that you can talk about them in
        detail. Filling out a grid like this may help:</string>
    <string name="belowTable">Along the top, as columns, you should list all the major aspects of your resume, including each project, job,
        or activity. Along the side, as rows, you should list the common behavioural questions.
        Study this grid before your interview. Reducing each story to just a couple of keywords may make the grid
        easier to study and recall. You can also more easily have this grid in front of you during an interview without
        it being a distraction.

Also typical answers are<br />provided to give you a head-start. <br /><br />There are <em>tips</em> on interview types and what to do\'s and not to do\'s so you feel confident when you have your first ever interview. Even for job seekers who had their first couple interviews, these tips might still help you out and self-criticise.<br /><br />For <em>technical-based</em> interviews, it is important to know such algorithmic approaches and even if you know already, this will help you brush up on it. Thus, there are algorithms that explains what they are and providing generic code samples.<br /><br />

            <p>1. Highlight one personality trait at a time, sharing an example of a time when you demonstrated this quality.

        <!--What are your weaknesses?-->
        <item>
            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
           <p><strong>- Be authentic</strong>.<br />Don\'t select a weakness just because it sounds good. You will make a better impression with sincerity. That doesn\'t mean you have to share a weakness that makes you look bad. If you\'re like most of us, you have several weaknesses and at least one of them will be interview-friendly as defined by the additional guidelines below.</p>
<p><strong>- Pick a weakness that is acceptable for the job at hand.</strong><br />Be aware of the job requirements and don\'t cite a weakness related to any of the required skills or desired qualities. If you\'re an accountant, don\'t talk about hating math or lack of attention to detail. If you\'re in sales, don\'t confess to being too reserved or lacking persistence.</p>
<p><strong>- Select a weakness that is relatively minor and fixable.</strong><br />By fixable, I mean it\'s something you can improve through work and motivation.</p>
<pre><strong>Examples:</strong><br /> - I think one area I could work on is my delegation skills. I am always so concerned about everything being done right and<br />on time that I can get stuck in that mentality of "If you want it done right, do it yourself." Unfortunately, that\'s not always possible and I\'ve realized that I can slow things down if I am too controlling.<br />I learned this recently when given the opportunity to manage the department\'s summer interns. I had never managed direct reports before, so this was a hugely educational experience in many different ways.<br />It definitely taught me how to delegate and my manager noticed the difference in my management style at the end of the summer.<br />I know that I can benefit from additional development in this area, so I signed up for a management skills training course and<br />am always looking for opportunities to manage projects for our group.<br /><br /> - Honestly, I would say that public speaking is an area that I could work on.<br />I tend to get nervous when asked to present to a large group of people. In small team meetings, I\'m the first one to stand up and<br />present. But put me in front of a big group and I can get flustered. I actually spoke to my manager about this and we set it as one of my development goals for this year.<br />I took an internal presentation skills class and attended some meetings of Toastmasters, a networking group for people who want to practice public speaking. With some practice, I started to feel more comfortable.<br />Last month, I even volunteered to represent our team at a division-wide town hall. I only had to present for 10 minutes, but I did it and got great feedback! It was actually kind of fun,<br />so I plan on continuing to seek out opportunities to improve in this area.<br /><br /> - Sometimes I can be a bit too honest when I provide feedback to coworkers. My personality is naturally very straightforward and to the point, and most of my colleagues really value that, but I have learned that there are times on the job<br />when more diplomacy is required. I took a training class on conflict management and it really opened my eyes to the need to communicate differently with different people. So now I am much better at providing constructive feedback, even if it doesn\'t always come naturally.

        <!--How do you handle a challenge?-->
        <item>
            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
            <p>1. Recall a challenge that was significant, but one that you consider a success. Most importantly, you want to be able to discuss a real professional challenge, not an arbitrary or annoying occurrence. You also want to be able to define how you met the challenge successfully. If possible, mention a challenge most relevant to the role you\'re applying to. In your answer,&nbsp;you\'ll want to set up the challenge clearly and succinctly.<br /><br />2. Don\'t just say what you did - explain how you did it. The employer is interested in learning your approach to a challenge, including the actions you took and your thought process. Don\'t skip ahead to the end result. Use specifics to describe what you did to contribute to the solution.<br /><br />3. Emphasize the outcome and what you learned from it. Employers want to hire individuals who can turn challenges into opportunities. When brainstorming an answer, think about ways to emphasize how you made the most of a difficult time. Of course, in the real world, it\'s not possible to wave a magic wand and transform every difficulty into a grand success. It is possible to learn from your hardships, and then apply what you learned to future challenges.<br />Make sure you express your takeaways and how you\'ve grown from your challenges.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />- One time, my supervisor needed to leave town unexpectedly, and we were in the middle of a touchy negotiation with a new sponsor. I was tasked with putting together a PowerPoint presentation just from the notes he had left, and some briefing from his manager.<br />My presentation turned out successfully - we got the sponsorship, and the management team recommended me for an award.</p>

            <p>The employer wants to see that you can keep a calm head when difficult situations arise, so share a narrative that shows your ability to resolve conflicts.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />- We had a customer who complained frequently and was becoming hostile toward customer service reps. I did some investigating and discovered that our CS agents were repeating the same templated scripts to him and he felt as though his complaints weren\'t being heard. I helped devise an escalation system so that this endless CS loop wouldn\'t happen again. Then I contacted the customer personally to apologize and thank him for helping us find and fix a glitch in our process.</p>

           <pre>You will probably want to provide an answer that highlights your ability to solve problems in the role you are interviewing for.<br />you will want to avoid giving a vague or general answer. If you are interviewing for the computer engineer role - you would want to discuss the software involved- the other engineers on the team- and the technological process you used to<br />solve the software issue. Just be as detailed as possible- and describe the situation using multiple perspectives.<br /><br />As always, use the STAR format as a framework for your story. The STAR format will help you focus your thoughts and turn your example into an interesting (non-rambling) and convincing (impressive) story.<br />    <br /><strong>- S/T (Situation/Task)</strong>
Give a brief overview of the project or situation. Provide only enough background to give context and help your interviewer understand the difficulty and importance.</pre>
<p>1. In my role as Business Development Manager at XYZ Inc., I was responsible for a team of five tasked with organizing all of our client events.</p>
<p>2. As you may know, XYZ Inc. is a top provider of enterprise security software.</p>
<p>3. Our client events are key to driving revenue. We host conferences and other events that feature expert speakers on key issues in the industry.</p>
<p>- <strong>A(Approach)</strong><br />Once you\'ve set up the problem, it\'s time to walk through the key actions that you took to address it. What exactly did you do and why?</p>
<p>1. When I sat down to start planning the 2013 event schedule, I knew that it would be critical to get attendance back to at least 2011 levels.</p>
<p>2. I sat down with my team members and I also interviewed our top sales representatives. I had some ideas about why attendance had dropped,<br />but I wanted to look at it from all angles. Our sales reps felt like we could do a better job marketing the events through social media.</p>
<p>3. We also sent out a questionnaire to past attendees and partners and asked for their input on how we could improve our<br />events. In the feedback, we saw some key themes emerging &mdash; our clients had great ideas for new topics and speakers and we also<br />saw a clear desire for more structured networking as part of the events.</p>
<pre> - <strong>R(Results)</strong><br />Remember that a good STAR interview story always features a happy ending. The last part of your answer should describe the<br />positive result(s) of the actions that you took. Hard numbers are always especially impressive (increased revenue by 41%, came in 20% under budget or 2 weeks ahead of schedule), but anecdotal results can also be powerful<br />(My client said I was a hero, my VP gave me a raise based on my stellar performance).<br /><br />1. We saw the impact of our changes right away. We saw a lot of buzz on LinkedIn and Twitter and had a record number<br />of advance registrations for our first big event of 2013.<br /><br />2. For that event, we saw increased attendance of more than 25% over the previous year.<br />We also saw a huge improvement in our event evaluation scores.<br /><br />3. Particular, attendees really enjoyed the new networking component and<br />over 75% said they would be very likely to recommend the event to a colleague.</pre>

            <p>1. <strong>Pick the Right Challenge</strong><br />Whatever example you use, make sure it highlights a strength you would bring to the role.<br />For example, your flexibility and ability to navigate change, negotiating skills, or perseverance.<br />Your first move is to lay out exactly what the challenge was, and why it was important for the department.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />- In my previous position, I was in charge of selecting vendors to print our promotional materials. We have a long-time vendor we\'ve been working with for over a decade. However, for one of our biggest print jobs of the year, another vendor came in with a lower bid.<br /><br />2. <strong>Discuss how you weighed the options</strong><br />The interviewer is interested in learning how you think. Put yourself in their shoes. Any job comes with problems, and<br />they want to know you\'ll be purposeful and careful in weighing the options.<br />The second part of the answer should give a glimpse into the thought process you went through.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />- I didn\'t want to take the work away from a vendor with whom we did so much business with, but I couldn\'t justify picking them out of loyalty if someone else was doing the same job for less money. So, I told the old vendor frankly about the other bid to hear what they had to say, and I also solicited references from the new vendor to see if their work matched that of what we had been getting.<br /><br />3. <strong>Tell the interviewer what choice you made</strong><br />Make like Houdini and dazzle your audience with the reveal. Tell the interviewer what choice you came to.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />- Our long-time vendor was able to bring down their bid. They actually did the job for less than the new vendor would have, so we ended up saving some money.</p>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
             <p>The best way to answer this question is to talk about a specific example of a time you made a mistake. Briefly explain what the mistake was, but don&rsquo;t dwell on it. Quickly switch over to what you learned, or how you improved, after making that mistake. You might also explain the steps you took to make sure that mistake never happened again.<br /><br />When talking about what you learned, try to emphasize skills or qualities you gained that are important for the job you&rsquo;re interviewing for now. You might also explain that something you struggled with a long time ago has actually become one of your strengths.<br /><br />You want your example of a mistake to be honest. However, it\'s a good idea not to mention a mistake that would be critical for success in the new position. For instance, give an example from your last position that isn\'t specifically related to the job requirements for the new position.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- One thing I have learned from past mistakes is when to ask for help. I have learned that it is far better to ask for clarification and solve an issue right away than to be unsure. I know that your company emphasizes teamwork and the need to be in constant communication with one another, and I think my ability to ask (and answer) questions of my peers would help me fit in very well with your company culture.<br /><br />- I\'m the kind of person who tries to learn and grow from every mistake. Years ago, a team I was working on failed to land a sale, and we were told it had to do in part with our ineffective visuals. Over the next six months, I spent much of my free time learning how to use various software programs to create enticing visual presentations. Since then, I\'ve been continuously praised for my visuals in meetings and sales pitches.</p>

            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
            <p>The best way to answer this question is to give an example of how you have handled stress in a previous job. That way, the interviewer can get a clear picture of how well you work in stressful situations. Avoid mentioning a time when you put yourself in a needlessly stressful situation. For example, do not share a story about a time when you were stressed because you procrastinated and had to finish a project quickly.<br />Rather, describe a time when you were given a difficult task or multiple assignments, and you rose to the occasion.<br /><br />You also should not focus too much on how stressed out you felt. While you should certainly admit that stress happens, emphasize how you dealt with the stress, rather than how it bothered you. If possible, avoid saying you are stressed by a situation that will be common in the job for which you are applying.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- I had been working on a key project that was scheduled for delivery to the client in 60 days. My supervisor came to me and said that we needed to speed it up and be ready in 45 days, while keeping our other projects on time.<br />I made it into a challenge for my staff, and we effectively added just a few hours to each of our schedules and got the job done in 42 days by sharing the workload.<br />Of course, I had a great group of people to work with, but I think that my effective allocation of tasks was a major component of the success of the project.<br /><br />- Pressure is very important to me. Good pressure, such as having a lot of assignments to work on, or an upcoming deadline, helps me to stay motivated and productive. Of course, there are times when too much pressure can lead to stress; however, I am very skilled at balancing multiple projects and meeting deadlines, which prevents me from feeling stressed often.<br />For example, I once had three large projects due in the same week, which was a lot of pressure. However, because I created a schedule that detailed how I would break down each project into small assignments, I completed all three projects ahead of time and avoided<br />unnecessary stress.<br /><br />- I am very sensitive to the nuances of group dynamics. If there\'s an unhealthy amount of competition or criticism between team members, this negativity can start to affect my own work performance. And so what I do is to try to proactively listen to the concerns of the people around me, checking in frequently to see if they themselves are under stress. If they are, I think about how I can help them with their workload so the collective stress of the team doesn\'t escalate. When the team\'s happy, I\'m happy.</p>

            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
            <p>For more senior-level roles (any position with direct reports), it\'s important to communicate your ability to jump in and assume a leadership role immediately. The best way to do this is to demonstrate that you\'ve done it successfully in the past.<br />For other roles, the leadership challenge may be to lead and motivate people who DON\'T report to you. For example, any project management role or position that requires gaining cooperation and/or buy-in from other departments.<br />For other positions (even entry-level jobs), companies ask about leadership because they want to hire people with leadership potential individuals who can grow with the company and have superstar potential.<br /><br />Here\'s an overview of how to use the STAR format specifically to present a leadership experience:<br /><br /><strong>S/T (Situation/Task)</strong><br />Briefly describe the project or situation. Give just enough history and/or background to provide context.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>- When I was at ABC Company, we went through some company-wide lay-offs.</p>
<p>- The team of five that remained in the department had to absorb the duties of the two that left.</p>
<p>- At the same time, more mistakes were being made because attention was so scattered.</p>
<pre><strong>A (Approach)</strong><br />Talk about the key actions that you took. When telling a leadership story, make sure that you convey specifically how you stepped up as a leader.<br />What actions did you take and why? How did your actions demonstrate leadership?<br /><br /><strong>Examples:<br /></strong>- I scheduled a meeting of the full team to discuss strategies.<br /><br />- I made it clear that this was a brainstorming meeting to come up with options - that no idea was stupid and that it was a safe environment<br />for making suggestions.<br /><br />- I asked for their assistance in identifying ways for us all to be more efficient - including me!</pre>
<pre><strong>R (Results)</strong><br />A strong STAR interview story always includes a happy ending. Wrap up your example by describing the positive outcome(s)<br />of your action. Quantifiable results are particularly impressive (boosted sales by 32%, saved the organization $19K),<br />but anecdotal results also can work well (My client was delighted and sang my praises to my manager, my VP loved our creative<br />approach and promoted me).<br /><br /><strong>Examples: <br /></strong>- First of all, the team responded very positively to this approach. They loved the idea of being empowered to help find a solution. Instead of complaining, they channeled their energy in a more productive way once they knew that they would be heard. <br /><br />- Right off the bat, we came up with two ideas that could be implemented quickly and save us a lot of time.<br /><br />- We are now more efficient and morale is way up.</pre>

            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
            <p>Before an interview, think of at least two team situations when you displayed some of the teamwork skills listed above. At least one of these examples should include a moment when you helped solve a problem or challenge that struck the group.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- During my last semester in college, I worked as part of a research team in the History department. The professor leading the project was writing a book on the development of language in Europe in the Middle Ages. We were each assigned different sectors to focus on, and I suggested that we meet independently before our weekly meeting with the professor to discuss our progress, and help each other out if we were having any difficulties. The professor really appreciated the way we worked together, and it helped to streamline his research as well. He was ready to start on his final copy months ahead of schedule because of the work we helped him with.<br /><br />- When I was a junior, I worked on a case project for a marketing class where six of us were asked to analyze the marketing practices of Amazon.com and make recommendations for alternative approaches. Early on we floundered in an effort to find a focus. I suggested that we look at Amazon\'s advertising strategy within the social media. I led a discussion about the pros and cons of that topic and encouraged a couple of the more reticent members to chime in. Two of the group members didn\'t initially embrace my original proposal. However, I was able to draw consensus after incorporating their suggestion that we focus on targeted advertising within Facebook based on users\' expressed interests. We ended up working hard as a group, receiving very positive feedback from our professor, and getting an A grade on the project.<br /><br />- I have years of experience on team projects at my previous marketing job and that has helped me develop into a strong listener who can resolve conflict and ensure timely completion of projects. About a year ago, I was working on a team project with a tight deadline. One team member felt that his voice was not being heard, and as a result, he wasn\'t working quickly enough on his element of the project. I sat down with him and listened to his concerns, and together we came up with a way for him to feel he had more input in the project. By making him feel listened to, I helped our team complete the project successfully and on time.</p>

And you need to show how you actively, not passively, resolved the situation. You don\'t necessarily have to be the one who solved the entire problem, though if you did, good job for you for showing initiative. Many times, however, calling in the right people is the best and most appropriate form of action. Either way, don\'t be shy about telling this to your interviewer.<br /><br />A third part of answering this type of question involves sharing your personal philosophy.<br />Your philosophy can be about your work ethic in general or certain industry-specific issues.<br />Don\'t stress about coming up with a major problem. Not everyone can rescue a company from financial ruin. A problem can be as simple as helping two colleagues who disagree about how to address a task resolve their differences. What you perceive as a problem and how you choose to resolve it tells a whole lot about who you are as a person.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- A few years ago, I had a supervisor who wanted me to find ways to outsource most of the work we were doing in my department. I felt that my department was one where having the staff on premises had a huge impact on our effectiveness and ability to relate to our clients. I presented a strong case to her, and she came up with a compromise plan.</p>
<p>- Once I found a major flaw in the work of one of the most senior members of the department, which could have been very costly to the company if it had been overlooked. I went directly to him and called it to his attention so he could fix it before it affected the final outcome.</p>
<p>- I feel that the best way to deal with any challenges is to meet them head-on. When I found that one of my colleagues was saying things that weren\'t true behind my back, I went to him and talked it through. It turned out that he had misunderstood what I had said, and I was able to set the record straight with him, and my supervisor.</p>

            <p>It\'s okay to be honest here, but don\'t bash your former colleague. It\'s important to show that you can be flexible and overcome challenges.<br /><strong><br />Examples:</strong><br />- I had a supervisor who was ultra-creative, and so he had a creative person\'s impulse-driven approach to projects. I need more structure, so we worked together to develop an Asana project where he could add creative input when inspiration struck, and I had a central place for project notes to keep me on task.</p>

            <p>Like it or not, we\'re working more hours these days. Although you don\'t want to become a slave to the office, if your prospective employer has asked you this question, you can be sure she\'s going to need you to be a team player.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />- I try to keep a good work/life balance, so I\'d do my best to help my team meet project goals during working hours. That said, crunch times happen. I\'m dedicated to putting in the extra hours when they become necessary.</p>

            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
            <p>You need to show you have come out on the other side of this error ultimately a better employee. Did you learn to become better organized? Do you hold yourself to a higher standard than you did previously? After discussing the story behind your mistake- talk about how you are a better worker because of it. At the end of the day- this is what prospective employers want to see in a candidate- one they know has the capability to grow.<br /><br />Admitting that you have made mistakes is one thing- but it is another thing entirely to mention something extremely detrimental about your personality that could prevent you from getting the job entirely. For example- talking about a time when you missed an important meeting with a client because you spent all of the previous night partying- slept in and forgot to set your alarm might not be the best story to go with. There is generally no need to go into the reasons for why the mistake happened - you just need to get into the story.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- Last year I was leading a team of coworkers to secure a deal with a new client that would have gotten us a lot of business. We did not get it and as leader of the team I accepted full responsibility. I took it upon myself to reach out to the potential client to see what we could have done better. It turned out our business just was not as experienced as the company they went with so I talked with my boss about how we could accentuate other positive aspects of the company to any future clients. A few months later- another client surfaced- and by implementing different strategies- we landed the deal.<br /><br />- I think the worst mistake I ever made at work was in my first ever job - five years ago now.<br />A more senior member of the team seemed to take an instant dislike to me from the start - and one day she was particularly unpleasant to me in front of several colleagues. Later on, I was talking to one of those colleagues who was, I thought, attempting to console me. Angry and hurt, I foolishly vented my feelings and told her what I thought of the lady in question.<br />I was naturally shocked to find out that she went on to tell everyone what I had said and this certainly didn\'t help my relationship with the team member who was causing me problems. Rather than let the situation carry on, I chose to have a quiet word with this lady so as to find out what her problem was with me and to see if we could put it behind us. It turned out it was nothing personal; she just resented the fact that a friend of hers had also been interviewed<br />for my position and had been turned down. Once we had got matters out into the air, her behaviour changed and we actually got on quite well after that. However, I certainly learned a lot from the experience. I learned that careful communication is vital in managing interpersonal relationships and that if I have a problem with someone it\'s always best to talk it over with them rather than with someone else.</p>

            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
           <p>The most common mistake is to NOT answer the question. I can understand why a candidate might freeze up if asked about a failure. If you haven\'t prepared to address this topic, it can be daunting to try to instantly think of a good example and then describe it in a diplomatic way that shows you are both honest and a smart hire. Many candidates will um and uh for a while and finally say something like: "Well, I can\'t think of any serious failures. I guess I\'ve been fortunate to be pretty successful in most of my positions so far&hellip;" That might seem like a safe way to answer. However, from the interviewer\'s perspective, you\'re not answering the question at all.<br /><br />Here are some guidelines for selecting the right example:<br /><br />1. Choose a real failure. You must answer the question. Don\'t go with something like: "We only improved sales by 35%, but I wanted to do more, so I felt like a failure. I guess I\'m just a perfectionist." (insert a humblebrag shrug)<br /><br />2. Don\'t raise red flags. At the same time, you don\'t have to confess your deepest and darkest secrets. Don\'t choose a failure that was the result of a serious personal mistake (totally forgot to attend the meeting) or character flaw (probably shouldn\'t have called the client "Sweet cheeks"). A team failure can work well because you share responsibility with others (just make sure you acknowledge your role and don\'t try to pass the buck completely).<br /><br />3. Focus on the learning. Pick a story that ends with a compelling example of a lesson learned.<br />Ideally, you should be able to point to applying your hard-won knowledge/skills successfully on a subsequent project.<br /><br /><strong>S/T (Situation/Task)</strong><br />This is the "backstory." Provide an overview of the project or situation. Keep it concise and give only enough background for context.</p>
<p>- I would say that my biggest professional failure was in my current role as a project manager at ABC Consulting Corp.</p>
<p>- Last year, our team failed to land a $2 million new project from one of our existing clients.</p>
<p>- The project should have been ours, but we dropped the ball.</p>
<pre><strong>A (Approach)</strong><br />After you have given a brief background of what the failure was, it\'s time to walk through a bit more detail about<br />what happened and why.<br /><br />- I think the biggest issue was that the whole team took it for granted that the project would be ours.<br /><br />- We had a good relationship with the client and we had just wrapped up a very successful project for them.<br /><br />- But in retrospect, we didn\'t go the extra mile to wow them. We didn\'t push as hard as we should have.That opened up the opportunity for a competitor to put on a big show and steal the business.</pre>
<p>- A team of us, led by the account manager, went to pitch. It was a solid pitch and we got great feedback.</p>
<pre><strong>R (Results)</strong><br />A good STAR interview story always features a happy ending. With a failure story, your R section will be a<br />little different than usual. With a typical STAR answer, the R describes the positive outcome(s) of the actions that<br />you took (increased sales, reduced costs, winning presentation).<br /><br />- Losing the business was a real blow to the company - financially and from a morale perspective too.<br /><br />- Our #1 lesson as a team was to never take a client for granted - and to never, ever settle for a "good-enough" pitch.<br />We have to hit all of our presentations out of the park. And I can honestly say that we\'ve done so ever since -<br />and it has led to a record year for new business in our group.<br /><br />- Personally, I learned that I need to pay more attention to the dynamics within the client organization and read between the lines more.</pre>

            <![CDATA[<html><pre style="text-align:center">
            <p>The interviewer wants to know that you can learn new skills, under pressure. Hiring managers want to hear that you are willing to put in the effort required to learn new skills, even when it may seem difficult.<br /><br />Think about times when your company implemented new software, or when you learned a new procedure. Perhaps your employer has asked you to attend a workshop at the last minute, or you had to study for a policy exam. These make great examples! Discuss how you diligently studied related materials, attended a training seminar, or bought a book to help you learn the new content.<br /><br />Keep in mind; this is another excellent opportunity to express that you accept workplace changes with ease.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- In my most recent role, I was unfamiliar with their hospital record keeping system. After a few days of on the job training, I was able to maintain the hospital record keeping system, but I still wasn\'t happy with my fluency. I found tutorials online and spent evenings training myself to a deeper level of knowledge. It was nice to dive in, learn the system well, and have that sense of accomplishment early on in my role.<br /><br />- When I first began my administration career, I started as a temp with an agency.<br />Placed in a variety of roles that changed weekly and sometimes even daily, I often jumped into roles where there was a lot to learn in a short time. Deadlines were often due yesterday. I utilized and maximized my resources to the fullest. I learned about plenty of industries and best of all, had fun doing it!<br /><br />- When I started my first sales position, I took a pay cut for a highly commissioned opportunity. I had to hit the ground running to get commissioned more quickly and move up the ranks. I had to learn the car industry in no time so that I could start making appointments and sales. I spent the first week shadowing everyone I could, reading the industry publications after hours, and even went to a dealership on the weekend to walk through as though<br />I were purchasing a used car. I wanted to understand them from the customer perspective. By Monday, I felt fully ramped and was making appointments and running demos.</p>

            <p>The way you answer this question shows what you value, where you find satisfaction and can let them know if you will be a good fit in their company. What you find important shows them the kind of environment you will do well in. Their job is to figure out if you\'ll do well in their company\'s environment, so they ask a lot of questions that will help them learn more about you. Many companies look for self-motivated individuals who will push themselves towards success rather than need to be pushed.<br /><br /><strong>Points to Emphasize:</strong><br />You know that the interviewer is trying to figure out what motivates you, so there are a few key traits that you want to make sure to touch on.<br /><br />- Try to focus on experiences and traits that can tie into the position you are applying for.<br />- Talk about what led you to the moment that made you so proud.<br />- Discuss what you did after this moment of success.<br />- Give details about how you plan to achieve this pride again.<br />- Letting the interviewer know that you strive to have proud moments again will show that you have goals for yourself.<br /><br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br />- I am most proud of when one of the biggest clients of company ABC was about to switch suppliers and I had to stop them from switching. I used the excellent personal relationship that I had built up with the client over the past year to persuade them to stay with our company and negotiated new terms. The result was that they placed even more orders than the previous quarter.<br /><br />- I am most proud of when a Google algorithm update made the company I was working for organic traffic plummet and their Adwords spend increase. My job was to fix the site to make sure that it was compliant with the new Google Update and also wouldn\'t be affected by any updates for the foreseeable future. I spent hours fixing the blog and putting a new content plan in place to keep everything controlled. The plan worked, the organic traffic picked up, and the company reduced its Adwords budget.<br /><br />But, don\'t limit your response purely to work achievements; personal accomplishments can be just as important and telling. If this is to be your first job, there may be things you achieved at college or university that you were particularly proud of. If you\'ve had a break from employment to raise a family, you could be most proud of what your children have achieved because of the values you instilled in them as they were growing up.</p>

            <pre>While you don\'t need to be incredibly specific with this answer, demonstrate your understanding of the company and industry and clearly communicate the path you\'re on:<br /><br />- Details your accomplishments to date to show that you have already been able to effectively achieve goals.<br /><br />- Delineate the ways in which your goals align with the job at hand.<br /><br />- Describe any tangible achievements on the horizon.<br /><br />- Convince the interviewer that this position is key to your plan for success.<br /><br />- Describe your personal qualities that will enable you to achieve your goals.</pre>
<pre>Avoid answering in a way that puts the focus on salary (raises, bonuses, commission) or job titles.<br />While you want to avoid a vague response, it\'s best to stay away from goals that may or may not be something you can achieve at the<br />company. \n You wouldn\'t, for instance, want to lay out your strategy for being promoted to a management-level position while interviewing at<br />a company that doesn\'t have that role available.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br /> - When I started working for XYZ Company, I wanted to achieve the Employee of the Month title. It was a motivational<br />challenge, and not all the employees took it that seriously, but I really wanted that parking spot, and my picture on the wall.<br />I went out of my way to be helpful to my colleagues, supervisors, and customers - which I would have done anyway, I liked the<br />job and the people I worked with. The third month I was there, I got the honor. It was good to achieve my goal, and I actually<br />ended up moving into a managerial position there pretty quickly, I think because of my positive attitude and perseverance.</pre>

           <p>The goal is to evaluate how the candidate deals with adversity, disappointment, and failure.<br />(Plus, sometimes knowing when to give up is as important as knowing when to start.)</p>
<p><strong>Typical Structure</strong>&nbsp;<br />The interviewee set a huge goal, didn\'t achieve that goal, takes responsibility for not having achieved the goal... and not only takes responsibility but also learned from the experience: About himself, about what to do next time, about what motivates him, about what is truly important to him...</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />- In my last job we were given the opportunity to pitch for a major contract - at relatively short notice. I was part of a team that spent a good couple of weeks working very hard on the tender and it was clear that our company was undoubtedly the best choice for the contract. Unfortunately, the client had employed a rather inexperienced individual to review the tenders and they fell for a competitor\'s sales pitch - which had a lot less substance but a lot more spin. It was a major blow. I was naturally very disappointed at what seemed a very unfair decision, especially having put so much effort into the tender - but I wrote it down to experience and got on with successfully bidding for other contracts. The following year, the client having been very dissatisfied with our competitor\'s performance, we were asked to re-tender for the contract. This time, we won it. We did of course learn some lessons from our previous failure but, most of all, we were fortunate that the individual responsible for reviewing the tenders this time was a lot more experienced.</p>
